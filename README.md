# Meshtastic Plugin
Offical Meshtastic ATAK Plugin for sending CoT to IMeshService in the Meshtastic Android app.

# Settings
The plugin currently has the following settings:
- Enable relay to server, this forwards all CotEvents (except DMs) to any connected TAKServers
- Show all Meshtastic devices, this will place Sensor CoTs on the map for meshtastic devices that have non-zero GPS
- Do not show your local node, this will not place a Sensor CoT on the map for the meshtastic device currently bound to the EUD
- Enable reporting rate controls, this will set ATAK's reporting rate to Constant and allow you to pick a interval from 1,5,10,20,30 minutes
- Reporting rate, the menu to pick the interval
