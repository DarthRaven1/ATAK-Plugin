# Meshtastic Plugin
Offical Meshtastic ATAK Plugin for sending CoT to IMeshService in the Meshtastic Android app.

# Settings
The plugin currently has two settings:
- Enable relay to server, this forwards all CotEvents (except DMs) to any connected TAKServers
- Show all Meshtastic devices, this will place Sensor CoTs on the map for meshtastic devices that have non-zero GPS
